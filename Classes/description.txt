[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This little mod was suggested very recently on the mod discussion, and I thought it could be really fun to play with and provide an alrernative way to kill things :)
Here there is basically one item only I had to design, which is the spike :p I created one of them based on the sticky mine I designed for Rico Rodirgoat, except that the spike won't be able to explode. The shape itself is done by stretching a carrot item and replacing it's texture with some black and white squares X)
Then most of the work was done, I had to tweak the sticky behaviour a bit to make sure spikes will keep the right angle when they fly and when they touch something, and I ended with a quite satisfying result :) All I had to do after that was to stick a bunch of those onto the goat back, and give it the ability to shoot some spikes as well.
Also, as many people were requestions ways to kill regular NPCs, I decided to add this behaviour to this mod: This way you can choose how you kill your people, either with dark magic, with deadly punches or with a lot of spikes :p
